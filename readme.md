# Normalization

    Functional Dependency
    Normal forms

## Functional Dependency

> Functional dependency in simple terms means that the value of one attribute (or set of attributes) uniquely determines the value of another attribute(s) in a table.

## Normal Forms

> A set of rules applied to a database table to reduce redundancy and avoid anomalies in data by organizing it properly.

    0NF
    1NF
    2NF
    3NF

## 1NF Rules 📝

    - Atomic Values
    - Unique Column Names
    - Positional dependency of data
    - Column should contain data
    - that are of the same type
    - Determine Primary key

## 2NF Rules 📝

    Must be in 1NF
    No non-key attribute
    should depend on part of a candidate key

## 3NF Rules 📝

    Must be in 2NF
    Must not contain transitive dependency
